- User must be granted svn access rights through the project admin site
  (Project Manage this Project / Members)
- User must generate on his workstation a pair of DSA or RSA keys 
 e.g.: through Eclipse / Window / Preferences / General / Network Connections
                / SSH2 / Key Management / Generate DSA Keys
  user must choose (and record) a pass phrase and save the keys on his workstation
  (e.g. save private key under xxx.txt and public key under xxx.txt.pub ; they will be in OpenSSH format)
- User must upload his public key to the Java Net site
 (through User / Profile / Edit My Profile / SSH Keys / Add public key and paste ;
  the update may take some delay)
- The load your private key into memory : run pageant.exe, View keys / Add key, type passphrase
  If pageant is not started, you will get the following error : 
  'PuTTY Fatal Error / Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available.'
